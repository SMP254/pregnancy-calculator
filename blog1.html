  <h1>How to Accurately Calculate Your Pregnancy Due Date (Even With Irregular Periods)</h1>

  <p><strong>Wondering when your baby is due?</strong> Whether your menstrual cycle is regular or not, knowing how to calculate your due date is one of the first and most important steps in your pregnancy journey.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ’¡ Why Knowing Your Due Date Matters</h2>
  <p>Your due date helps track fetal development, schedule ultrasounds, and plan prenatal care. While only about 5% of babies are born on their exact due date, itâ€™s still a vital estimate for both you and your doctor.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ§® How Due Dates Are Typically Calculated</h2>
  <p>The most common method is <strong>Naegeleâ€™s Rule</strong>, which adds <strong>280 days (or 40 weeks)</strong> to the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP).</p>

  <p>For example, if your LMP was January 1, 2025, your estimated due date would be around October 8, 2025.</p>

  <p>If your cycles are irregular, donâ€™t worry. You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the date of conception (if known)</li>
    <li>Use ovulation tracking (via basal temperature or LH tests)</li>
    <li>Get an early ultrasound to measure fetal size and estimate the gestational age</li>
  </ul>
