  <h1>How to Calculate Your Due Date Without Knowing Your Last Period</h1>

  <p>Don't remember the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP)? You're not alone. Many women aren't sure of their exact date — and that's okay. There are still ways to calculate your pregnancy due date accurately.</p>

  <h2>🍼 Why LMP Is Usually Used</h2>
  <p>The most common method to estimate your due date is by adding 280 days (or 40 weeks) to the first day of your last period. This method is called <strong>Naegele’s Rule</strong>.</p>

  <p>But what if you can't remember your LMP or your periods are irregular?</p>

  <h2>✅ Alternative Ways to Estimate Your Due Date</h2>

  <h3>1. 🧪 Use the Date of Conception (If Known)</h3>
  <p>If you know the day you conceived (for example, via IVF or tracked ovulation), add <strong>266 days</strong> to get an approximate due date.</p>

  <h3>2. 📈 Use Ovulation Tracking</h3>
  <p>If you were tracking ovulation with ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) or basal body temperature (BBT), estimate your due date by adding 266 days to the date of ovulation.</p>

  <h3>3. 🩺 First-Trimester Ultrasound</h3>
  <p>An early ultrasound (before 13 weeks) is the most accurate way to determine gestational age and your estimated due date. The baby's size is measured and compared with known growth averages.</p>

  <h3>4. 🖩 Use a Due Date Calculator</h3>
  <p>Try our <a href="https://duedatenow.online">free due date calculator</a> to get an estimate based on known dates or an assumed cycle length.</p>

  <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2>
  <p>For women with irregular cycles, always mention this to your doctor. They may base your due date more heavily on ultrasound results instead of your cycle history.</p>

  <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Even without your LMP, there are still reliable ways to estimate your due date. Whether it’s conception tracking, ovulation tests, or an ultrasound — you’re covered.</p>

  <p>🧡 Just remember: due dates are estimates, and only about 5% of babies are born exactly on their due date.</p>
