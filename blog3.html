  <h1>Why Your Doctor Might Change Your Due Date</h1>

  <p>You’ve calculated your due date, started planning... and then your doctor says it might be different. Sound familiar? Don’t panic — it’s actually common for due dates to shift slightly during pregnancy.</p>

  <h2>📅 How Due Dates Are Originally Calculated</h2>
  <p>Most due dates are estimated using <strong>Naegele’s Rule</strong>: count 280 days (40 weeks) from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). This assumes a regular 28-day cycle, with ovulation on day 14.</p>

  <p>But every body is different — and that’s where adjustments come in.</p>

  <h2>🔍 Why Your Doctor Might Adjust Your Due Date</h2>

  <h3>1. 🩺 Early Ultrasound Shows Different Growth</h3>
  <p>If your early ultrasound (usually before 13 weeks) shows a baby that’s measuring ahead or behind the expected size, your provider may adjust your due date based on that measurement.</p>
  <p>Ultrasounds are considered very accurate in the first trimester — often more than using your LMP.</p>

  <h3>2. 🔄 Irregular Menstrual Cycles</h3>
  <p>If you have irregular or long cycles, ovulation may have happened earlier or later than expected. Doctors may rely more on ultrasound data than your reported LMP.</p>

  <h3>3. 🧪 IVF or Fertility Treatments</h3>
  <p>If you conceived through IVF or fertility tracking, your due date might be based on egg retrieval or embryo transfer — not your LMP.</p>

  <h2>🧠 What It Means for You</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t worry — a change of a few days is normal and doesn’t mean anything is wrong</li>
    <li>Your due date is still just an estimate; most babies are born between 38 and 42 weeks</li>
    <li>Your prenatal care (tests, ultrasounds, milestones) will adjust with the new date</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>It’s perfectly normal for due dates to shift slightly during pregnancy. Your healthcare provider uses a mix of science and experience to estimate the best date for your baby’s arrival.</p>
