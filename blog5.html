  <h1>How Accurate Is My Pregnancy Due Date?</h1>

  <p>You've calculated your due date or gotten one from your doctor — but how accurate is it really? Will your baby actually arrive on that exact day?</p>

  <p>Let’s explore how due dates are calculated, what makes them more or less accurate, and what you can realistically expect.</p>

  <h2>📅 What Is a Due Date?</h2>
  <p>A due date is a prediction of when your baby might be born. It’s based on the average pregnancy length of <strong>280 days (40 weeks)</strong> from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP).</p>

  <p>However, only about <strong>4%–5% of babies</strong> are actually born on their estimated due date. Most come within a two-week window before or after.</p>

  <h2>🔍 How Is It Calculated?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Last Menstrual Period (LMP)</strong>: Adds 280 days to your last period. Most common method.</li>
    <li><strong>Ultrasound (usually around 8–12 weeks)</strong>: Measures baby’s size to estimate gestational age — often more accurate than LMP.</li>
    <li><strong>Ovulation date or IVF retrieval</strong>: Can be extremely precise if known.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧠 Which Method Is Most Accurate?</h2>
  <p>The <strong>first-trimester ultrasound</strong> is considered the most accurate tool for dating pregnancy, especially if your cycles are irregular or you’re unsure of your LMP.</p>

  <p>Here’s how accuracy compares:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📏 <strong>Ultrasound before 13 weeks:</strong> accurate within 5–7 days</li>
    <li>📏 <strong>LMP method:</strong> less accurate if you ovulate early/late or don’t remember your dates</li>
    <li>📏 <strong>Ultrasound after 20 weeks:</strong> less accurate due to varying baby growth rates</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📉 Why the Due Date Isn’t Exact</h2>
  <p>Many factors affect when labor begins:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your hormone levels and body signals</li>
    <li>Your baby’s development pace</li>
    <li>Medical conditions like gestational diabetes or high blood pressure</li>
    <li>If it’s your first baby (they often arrive later)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📌 So What Should You Expect?</h2>
  <p>Most full-term pregnancies last between <strong>37 to 42 weeks</strong>. If your baby comes anytime in that range, it’s still considered normal.</p>

  <p>Think of your due date as a helpful guide, not a deadline.</p>
