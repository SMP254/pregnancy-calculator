  <h1>What Happens If You Go Past Your Due Date?</h1>

  <p>Your due date has come and gone — but still no baby? Don’t worry! Most first-time moms go a few days over their due date, and it’s usually nothing to stress about.</p>

  <h2>🗓 What Does It Mean to Be “Overdue”?</h2>
  <p>A pregnancy is considered full term between <strong>37 and 42 weeks</strong>. If you reach 40 weeks, you're not officially “overdue” until you pass:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>41 weeks:</strong> Late-term</li>
    <li><strong>42+ weeks:</strong> Post-term</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Only about <strong>5%–7% of women</strong> go beyond 42 weeks with a confirmed due date.</p>

  <h2>👩‍⚕️ What Your Doctor Will Do</h2>
  <p>If you go past your due date, your doctor will monitor you and your baby more closely. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-stress tests to check baby’s heart rate</li>
    <li>Ultrasounds to measure fluid levels and movement</li>
    <li>Cervix checks for dilation or effacement</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧪 Risks of Going Too Far Past Your Due Date</h2>
  <p>Most overdue pregnancies are healthy, but the risks slightly increase after 41–42 weeks, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decreased amniotic fluid</li>
    <li>Placenta aging and functioning less efficiently</li>
    <li>Higher chance of a larger baby (macrosomia)</li>
    <li>Increased chance of needing a C-section</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💉 Will I Be Induced?</h2>
  <p>Induction is usually recommended sometime between <strong>41 and 42 weeks</strong>, especially if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have other risk factors (like high blood pressure)</li>
    <li>The baby’s size or heart rate is concerning</li>
    <li>You’ve reached 42 weeks with no signs of labor</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Induction can involve medications, membrane stripping, or breaking your water — your provider will discuss the safest option for you.</p>

  <h2>🧘 What You Can Do While You Wait</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Stay active (walking, stretching)</li>
    <li>Practice relaxation or breathing techniques</li>
    <li>Discuss safe natural induction methods with your doctor</li>
    <li>Rest — baby will come when ready!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Going past your due date can feel frustrating, but it’s very common. Stay in touch with your provider, watch for signs of labor, and keep your hospital bag ready.</p>
