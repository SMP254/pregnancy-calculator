  <h1>Top 10 Early Signs of Pregnancy</h1>

  <p>Think you might be pregnant? Some early symptoms can appear as soon as a week after conception — even before your missed period.</p>

  <p>Here are the most common early signs of pregnancy, and what to look for if you're trying to conceive.</p>

  <h2>1. 🤢 Nausea or Morning Sickness</h2>
  <p>This is one of the most well-known symptoms. It can start as early as 2–3 weeks after conception, often without vomiting.</p>

  <h2>2. 😴 Fatigue</h2>
  <p>Feeling unusually tired? Rising progesterone levels can make you sleepy all day, even if you’ve had enough rest.</p>

  <h2>3. 🎯 Missed Period</h2>
  <p>If your cycle is regular, missing a period is often the first solid clue. But some women have light implantation spotting and mistake it for a period.</p>

  <h2>4. 💧 Frequent Urination</h2>
  <p>Hormonal changes increase blood flow to your kidneys and bladder — making you pee more, even before your belly grows.</p>

  <h2>5. 🐘 Sore or Swollen Breasts</h2>
  <p>Your breasts may feel fuller, tender, or even tingly — similar to premenstrual symptoms but often more intense.</p>

  <h2>6. 🎢 Mood Swings</h2>
  <p>Sudden tears, frustration, or anxiety? Hormonal surges in early pregnancy can affect your emotions quickly.</p>

  <h2>7. 🍕 Food Cravings or Aversions</h2>
  <p>You may suddenly crave pickles or feel repulsed by your usual favorite foods. Smell sensitivity also increases.</p>

  <h2>8. 🌡 Slight Temperature Rise</h2>
  <p>If you’ve been tracking your basal body temperature (BBT), a persistent rise for 18+ days post-ovulation could mean you're pregnant.</p>

  <h2>9. 💥 Implantation Bleeding or Cramping</h2>
  <p>Some women notice light spotting or mild cramping when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterus (usually 6–12 days after ovulation).</p>

  <h2>10. 😵 Headaches or Dizziness</h2>
  <p>Low blood pressure and hormonal shifts can trigger headaches or feeling faint, especially in early pregnancy.</p>

  <h2>🎯 When to Take a Test?</h2>
  <p>The best time is after your missed period for accurate results. Some sensitive pregnancy tests can detect hCG hormone as early as 6–8 days after ovulation.</p>

  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re seeing several of these symptoms, take a test — and confirm with your healthcare provider.</p>

  <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Every woman and pregnancy is different. Some feel many symptoms early, while others feel none at all. The only way to confirm is through a test.</p>
