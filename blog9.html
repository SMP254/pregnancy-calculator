  <h1>How Soon Can You Take a Pregnancy Test?</h1>

  <p>If you're trying to conceive (or concerned about an unexpected pregnancy), you're probably asking: “How early can I take a test — and trust the result?”</p>

  <p>Let’s break down when pregnancy tests work best, and how early symptoms and timing can affect accuracy.</p>

  <h2>📆 The Short Answer</h2>
  <p>You can take a pregnancy test <strong>as early as 6–8 days after ovulation</strong>, but for the most accurate result, wait until after your missed period.</p>

  <p>That usually means <strong>14–15 days after ovulation (DPO)</strong> if your cycle is regular.</p>

  <h2>🔬 How Pregnancy Tests Work</h2>
  <p>Pregnancy tests detect <strong>hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin)</strong> — a hormone that starts rising after implantation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Implantation:</strong> Usually occurs 6–10 days after ovulation</li>
    <li><strong>hCG builds:</strong> After implantation, hCG roughly doubles every 48 hours</li>
    <li><strong>Urine tests:</strong> Most sensitive tests can detect 6–10 mIU/mL of hCG</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>⏱ When Should You Test?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🩸 <strong>Early Testing (6–10 DPO):</strong> May catch early positives, but also prone to false negatives</li>
    <li>⏳ <strong>Best Accuracy:</strong> The day of your missed period or later (typically 14–15 DPO)</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Most Reliable:</strong> First morning urine (concentrated hormone levels)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧪 Types of Pregnancy Tests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Standard strips:</strong> Often found in cheap bulk packs — sensitive and cost-effective</li>
    <li><strong>Digital tests:</strong> More expensive, but easy to read (“pregnant” or “not pregnant”)</li>
    <li><strong>Early detection tests:</strong> Brands like First Response can detect very low hCG 5–6 days before your period</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>❌ What Causes False Negatives?</h2>
  <p>If you test too early, your body might not have enough hCG to detect yet. Other factors include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Testing late in the day (diluted urine)</li>
    <li>Irregular ovulation or implantation timing</li>
    <li>Expired or faulty test kits</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>The wait can be tough — but testing too early might leave you confused. For peace of mind and accuracy, it’s best to test on or after the day of your expected period.</p>
